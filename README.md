# render-images
A simple js app that gives an insight of the promises

/*
Challenge:
  1. Create an array of promises using getImagePromise.
  2. Save the results of calling all of those promises 
     in one go to a const 'results'.
  3. If the promises resolve: 
     - log "All images loaded successfully!".
     - hide 'uploadContainer'
     - iterate over the results and render them to imgContainer.
  4. If the promises reject:
     - catch and log the error.
